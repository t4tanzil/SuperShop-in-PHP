Data Visualization: Includes a diagram (diagram.png) to illustrate the application's workflow and architecture.
Documentation and Presentation: Accompanied by detailed project documentation (SuperShop in PHP.pdf) and a presentation (SuperShop in PHP.pptx) explaining the development process and features.
Key Features

Dynamic Pages: Built with PHP, the application generates interactive web pages for a smooth user experience.
CSV File Integration: Simplifies inventory management and ensures structured data storage.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed with a straightforward layout for both customers and administrators.
Modular Design: Encourages scalability and future enhancements.

This project highlights my ability to work with PHP for building dynamic web applications while leveraging CSV files for data storage and management. It showcases a strong understanding of web development principles, user experience design, and backend operations.
